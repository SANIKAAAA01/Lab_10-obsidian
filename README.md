# Lab 10 – Data Visualization and GitHub Collaboration

## 🎯 Objective
To use a standard dataset in **R**, generate multiple plots, and collaboratively manage the project using **GitHub**.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 1. Team Formation
- Use the **same team** formed during the previous lab task.  
- Select **one team leader** to create the GitHub repository.  
- Add the following collaborator to your repository:  
  👉 [https://github.com/SwapnilFadte](https://github.com/SwapnilFadte)

---

## 📊 2. Data Selection
Use any **built-in R dataset**, such as:
- `iris`
- `mtcars`
- `airquality`
- `ToothGrowth`

---

## 📈 3. Plotting Tasks
Generate **at least 5 different plots** from your selected dataset.  
Example plots include:
- Histogram  
- Scatter Plot  
- Box Plot  
- Line Plot  
- Bar Plot  
- Pie Chart  

Each plot must include:
- ✅ Proper **title**  
- ✅ **Axis labels**  
- ✅ **Legends** (if required)

---

## 💻 4. Code Documentation
- Write clean, well-commented R code.  
- Save the file as: `lab10_<teamname>.R`
---

## 📄 5. PDF Report
Include the following in your report:
1. **Team details** (names + roll numbers)  
2. **Brief introduction** of the selected dataset  
3. **Screenshots** of all 5 plots  
4. **Explanations** for each plot  

Save the report as: `lab10_<teamname>.pdf`

---

## 🔗 6. GitHub Collaboration
Each team member must contribute **actively and equally** through:
- Adding or updating **code** or **report sections**
- **Merging** changes into the main branch
- **Pulling** updates to stay in sync with the team

Your repository should clearly reflect **individual contributions** from all members.

---

## 🚀 7. Submission
- Upload both files (`.R` script and `.pdf` report) to your GitHub repository.  
- Submit the **GitHub repository link** on the classroom portal.

---

## 📦 Deliverables
Your GitHub repository must contain: `lab10_<teamname>.R
lab10_<teamname>.pdf`
✅ Evidence of individual GitHub contributions from all members.
